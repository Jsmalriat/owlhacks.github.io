      Hackathons are programming marathons where students build services,
      gadgets, and apps to win prizes, and ultimately, recognition. Hackathons
      are a paradigm shift in technology education, and they have taken the
      world by storm. They encourage learning and innovation through
      collaboration and have produced some of the most capable thinkers and
      innovators of the next generation.
      <br />
      <br />ACM, ACM-W and TUDev will be throwing a 12hr hackathon titled
      "OwlHacks" on <b>March 30th, 2019.</b> Our hackathon will attract some of
      the top undergraduate developers, engineers, and designers in the
      Philadelphia area. This makes OwlHacks a great recruiting and marketing
      opportunity. We’re inviting companies to present their products and
      services for students to explore and leverage in their applications, and
      we would like you to be one of them.
    </p>
